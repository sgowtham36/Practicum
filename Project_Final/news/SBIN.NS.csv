0,2018-02-09,"The SBI Group on Friday reported a massive Rs. 1,886.57 crore net loss for the December quarter of current fiscal as its bad loans and provisions spiked.It had, in contrast, reported net profit of Rs. 2,152.14 crore for the October-December quarter of the last fiscal, 2016-17.The nation’s largest lender saw its net bad loans ratio spiking to 5.61 per cent of advances, from 4.24 per cent during the third quarter of 2017-18.The gross dud assets ratio jumped meanwhile from 7.23 per cent to cross the double digits mark at 10.35 per cent during the quarter under review.In absolute or gross terms, the bank at the standalone level had Rs. 1,99,141.43 crore of its assets as non- performing, up from Rs. 1,08,172.32 crore in the comparable period in 2016.Similarly, its net non-performing assets almost doubled to Rs. 102,370.12 crore, up from Rs. 61,430.45 crore, State Bank of India said in an exchange filing.The bank saw its non-interest income decline by 29.75 per cent, from Rs. 11,507 crore to Rs. 8,084 crore, as net interest income plunged due to mark-to-market losses from its treasury operations.Similarly, non-fee income fell 18.38 per cent from Rs. 14,401 crore to Rs. 11,755 crore.Fee income rose from Rs. 4,710 crore to Rs. 4,979 crore — a growth of 5.71 per cent.Receive the best of The Hindu delivered to your inbox everyday!Please enter a valid email address.",http://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/sbi-posts-surprise-q3-loss/article22706343.ece,0.078,0.082,0.84,-0.4389
1,2018-02-12," If the financial performance of India’s largest lender is anything to go by, an end to the severe bad loans crisis may be much farther beyond the horizon than previously anticipated. For the first time in almost 19 years, the State Bank of India reported a quarterly loss of ₹2,416 crore for the three months ended December, compared with a net profit of ₹2,610 crore in the year-earlier period. While the figures are not strictly comparable after SBI completed merger with its associates, the loss was the result of both a massive increase in provisions to account for bad loans and a substantial amount of mark-to-market losses on its holding of government bonds. Provisions for non-performing assets (NPAs) more than doubled to about ₹17,760 crore, from about ₹7,200 crore in the third quarter of 2016-17. On treasury operations, SBI recorded a loss of about ₹3,255 crore, versus a profit of about ₹4,776 crore in the comparable period. The bank revealed that an audit by the Reserve Bank of India showed a divergence of ₹23,239 crore in the way it classified assets at the end of the last financial year, which led to increase in provisions in the last quarter. Most of these reclassified assets are linked to troubled projects in sectors including power and telecom. SBI, of course, is not the only lender to have had its assets forcibly reclassified by the RBI. Private sector lenders have also been found guilty of pushing troubled assets under the carpet until the RBI called their bluff.It may be tempting to believe that last year’s bankruptcy law reforms will soon begin to ease the pain at banks by encouraging the quick sale of assets of troubled borrowers. The proceeds from such sales, however, would likely amount to very little in comparison with the mammoth scale of troubled assets. According to a joint study by Assocham and Crisil, gross NPAs in the banking system are estimated to increase to ₹9.5 lakh crore by March 2018, from ₹8 lakh crore a year earlier. In that case, write-offs recognising losses may be the most honest and practical way to deal with the bad loans problem. So the RBI in the coming months should continue to push banks, both public and private, to promptly recognise the stressed loans on their portfolios. Incidentally, Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week laid the blame for bad loans on the previous government. While it is quite true that the present bad loans crisis has been a long time in the making, the problem of lax corporate governance, which has plagued public sector banks and contributed in no small measure to the present crisis, still remains largely unaddressed by the government. Even the latest plan to recapitalise public sector banks may achieve little more than giving some temporary relief to lenders for the sake of reviving credit growth. The bad loans problem is likely to remain a festering sore and risks undermining the health of the economy until meaningful structural reforms to the banking system are undertaken. Receive the best of The Hindu delivered to your inbox everyday!Please enter a valid email address.",http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/unending-pain/article22734451.ece,0.096,0.152,0.752,-0.9898
2,2018-03-13," Despite a dip in retail inflation in February, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is unlikely to reduce key policy rates in 2018, analysts at brokerages said on Tuesday. Risks like the higher minimum support prices (MSPs) for food grains promised in the budget, according to them, can push up the inflation in the next fiscal year. However, economists at the country’s largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI) said that the “best is yet to come” and the RBI’s inflation targets will be undershot by up to 0.50 percentage points. Terming it as a “challenging period” for the central rate setting panel, Japanese brokerage Nomura said the rising MSPs are a risk and once inflation starts rising from the second quarter, the apex bank would turn more hawkish.“We expect rates to remain on hold throughout 2018 mainly because banking sector risks are still a downside risk to sustainable growth,” it said. Leading domestic credit ratings agency Crisil said while there is an improvement in the growth-inflation mix in numbers released yesterday, it is unlikely to result in any rate cut by the central bank in the next six months. It estimates the headline inflation for financial year 2018-19 at a high 4.6% on rising consumption demand, house rent allowance revisions and elevated crude prices. Retail inflation eased for the second straight month in February to 4.4%, while the factory output growth for January was at a two-month high of 7.5%, according to a data released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) yesterday. Economists at Singaporean bank DBS also said they continue to expect the RBI to stay put with a pause in 2018. The Rs.13,000-crore scam at the Punjab National Bank (PNB) featured prominently in many commentaries, with the analysts saying that it may hurt the recovery efforts underway in the economy. Nomura said the PNB fraud and the resultant provisioning and the treasury losses are a “downside risk” to growth, while according to DBS, it is a “cog in the wheel of a swift recovery“.State-run SBI highlighted the risks of inflation targeting framework in its note, saying the mark-to-market losses incurred by banks due to tightening of rates on policy expectations have exposed it to risks on the financial stability front. On the factory output growth, SBI said it may touch a double-digit growth for the first time in February.

3,2018-06-02," An unidentified man attempted to break into a State Bank of India branch in Coimbatore rural in the early hours of Saturday. The police said that the man escaped after an alarm went off during the attempt. The break-in attempt was reported at Karegoundenpalayam branch of SBI near Kempanaickenpalayam on Kariyampalayam - Karamadai Road around 1.40 a.m. on Saturday. Three persons living close to the bank namely Gopala Rama Krishnan, Karthick Babu and S. Vellingiri woke up after hearing an alarm. Though they thought it was an alarm from police patrol vehicle, they came out to check the source as it continued for nearly 10 minutes. After finding one of the shutters of the bank broken and left half open, Mr. Krishnan called B. Kajendari, who works as sweeper at the bank, over phone and alerted him. The woman in turn informed the manager and cashier of the bank. Meanwhile, Mr. Babu, who has rented space for the bank, alerted the Annur police about the incident. Bank manager M. Harish and cashier rushed to the bank and inspected the place with the police. Bank manager’s cabin, cashier’s room and steel bureaus were found open, while an iron rod was lying near the locker containing cash and jewellery, which the intruder could not break open. The police said that the intruder escaped after the alarm went off while attempting to open the cash locker. According to the police, there was no electricity in the locality from 8 p.m. on Friday and the alarm worked as it had power back up of UPS. The accused had damaged a surveillance camera kept in front of the bank, while three others inside the bank were spared. Scientific team of the police, fingerprint experts and dog squad were pressed into service. Karumathampatty DSP Jayachandran said that the investigation team had got a CCTV footage of the accused. “Bank authorities have said that no money was stolen,” he said. The bank was operated as State Bank of Travancore from 2014 till it merged with SBI in April 2017.

Public sector banks’ (PSBs) write-off stood at ₹27,231 crore in 2012-13, government data showed.The figure has jumped almost three-fold in five years.In 2013-14, the state-owned banks wrote off bad loans worth ₹34,409 crore; ₹49,018 crore in 2014-15; ₹57,585 crore in 2015-16, hitting ₹81,683 in the fiscal ended March 2017.

5,2018-01-24,"While most state-run banks that will received capital from the government will use it to meet provisioning requirement for accounts that facing bankruptcy proceedings as mandated by the banking regulator, State Bank of India (SBI)- the country’s largest lender - said the capital will be used to fund loan growth and not for regulatory purpose. P.K. Gupta, managing director of the bank discusses the bank’s plan in a exclusive interview.We were well capitlaised, we did not need the capital immediately. Going forward, for the purpose of funding credit growth, we might have required capital next financial year. So this will help in taking care of further growth capital requirement that we could have.For us this capital is not for regulatory purpose but for growth. For regulatory purpose we are adequately capitalised.As I said, since capital was not a constraint for the bank, we have been doing whatever requirement of credit that was coming to us. But so far the loan demand has been very muted. The demand which we are seeing now, is from the retail side. The corporate demand is very little. Hopefully, next year we will see more corporate demand coming in.We don’t need to raise any further capital immediately. We had also raised Rs 15,000 crore from the market during the current financial year. Also some demonetisation of assets has happened…we did that part sell of SBI Life Insurance.For us, the impact on capital adequacy ratio is about 44 bps points.Receive the best of The Hindu delivered to your inbox everyday!Please enter a valid email address.",http://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/capital-adequacy-ratio-will-go-up-by-44-bps/article22514704.ece,0.118,0.025,0.857,0.9737
6,2018-03-01,"For the first time in over two years, banks have started increasing the interest rates, indicating a change in the rate cycle.The country’s largest lender, the State Bank of India (SBI), and the largest private sector bank, ICICI Bank, increased lending rates by up to 20 bps (basis points) — a move that will increase equated monthly instalments for home, car loans for its customers.While the SBI has increased the one year marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) by 20 bps to 8.15%, ICICI Bank hiked it by 10 bps to 8.3%. MCLR is the benchmark rate to which all the loan rates are linked. Rates in all other tenures of MCLR have also been increased. Most loans are linked to one year MCLR. This is the first time banks have increased MCLR since its introduction in April 2016.The new rates, effective from March 1, will be applicable to new customers. For the existing customers, the new rates will come into effect when the interest rates are reset.A 10 bps increase in the lending rate for a ₹10 lakh home loan of 20 years will result in an EMI increase of ₹63.SBI MD P.K. Gupta clarified that while MCLR has gone up by 20 bps, home loan rates for up to ₹30 lakh — that is the affordable housing segment — the increase will be limited to 5 bps.The SBI and the Punjab National Bank (PNB) have also increased the deposit rates by up to 50 bps across various tenures.“The bond yields have gone up by over 50 bps in the last few months. Most of the other banks have increased their deposit rate in the last one month. So when we were comparing our deposit rate with other banks’ rates, we noted the difference has become quite wide. So we decided to realign our [deposit] rates with the market rates,” Mr. Gupta said. “And when you change your deposit rates, the impact is also on the MCLR. The impact of deposit rate hike on MCLR works out to 20 bps.”While the SBI will offer 6.40% interest rate on deposits for one year to 456 days, compared to 6.25% earlier, for deposits of over two years, it will pay 6.5%, compared to 6% earlier.For one-year deposits, the PNB will offer 6.75%, compared to 6.5% earlier.Banks have started raising their lending rates even though the Reserve Bank of India has kept the key policy rate or the repo rate unchanged since August 2017 monetary policy review, when it reduced the interest rates by 25 bps to 6%. While holding the rates steady, the central bank has maintained its neutral stance.However, banks' interest income is under pressure due to rise in bad loans that has lowered their interest earning assets and exerted pressure on net interest margins. Mr. Gupta said that since the lender had hiked both the deposit and lending rates, the impact on margins would not be significant.Receive the best of The Hindu delivered to your inbox everyday!Please enter a valid email address.",http://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/sbi-icici-bank-hike-lending-rates-emis-to-go-up/article22894870.ece,0.097,0.024,0.879,0.9886
7,2018-04-30," The country’s largest bank, the State Bank of India will not hold its annual meeting in Kolkata this year.It has been SBI’s decades-old tradition to announce its fourth-quarter results and thereby its annual results in the city. There will be a break with this tradition this year, it seems. This was confirmed by senior bank officials although they declined to give details or the factors leading to this major decision. Starting from the Chairman, the entire SBI board and senior management would be present on the occasion, which had also come to be regarded as a major media event.Incidentally there is no legal binding on SBI to hold its annual meet in this city as it is not based here. However this was a time-honoured tradition, maintained for sentimental reasons, which may now come to an end. SBI as it is known now, came into being through an Act of Parliament in May 1955 and through the takeover and integration of the erstwhile Calcutta-based Imperial Bank and some other banks. The Imperial Bank was created in 1921. Suggestions in certain quarters that the logistics and the costs involved in the entire exercise may have triggered the bank to break this tradition was dismissed by financial sector personnel who said that the event could well have been held at its recently operationalised training institute in Rajarhat.Receive the best of The Hindu delivered to your inbox everyday!Please enter a valid email address.",http://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/sbi-to-skip-annual-meet-in-kolkata/article23731475.ece,0.059,0.009,0.932,0.8832

So far, 100 applications have been received.

9,2018-03-14,"The Reserve Bank of India’s decision to ban Letters of Undertaking (LoUs) will raise costs for importers and will hurt export competitiveness, says SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar, in an exclusive interview. Edited excerpts:The cost of imports will go up. What was happening was importers, through the route of LoU, they were availing dollar funding which was cheaper than rupee funding. So now, the importer will have an option of either opening a letter of credit, but for that they will need suppliers’ agreement — the supplier should be willing to extend the credit. Or otherwise, they have to fund it through rupee borrowing. So, that will increase the cost. And if they are exporting, then it will impact your export competitiveness also.We have given our claim and all the supporting documents. Hopefully some repayment will happen this month.RBI has asked all the banks to integrate SWIFT with the core banking solution.All banks are now linking SWIFT with CBS.RBI has given a circular to do it by April 30. We will do it by that time.We thoroughly reviewed our LoU portfolio. Risk management in the bank is a continuous process and not a one-day process. Period review, see to it that checks and balances are working, you have to on a continuous basis.There are two ways to look at it. One is there are definitely bring more discipline on the borrowing. Borrowers will be more careful on how they manage their cash flow and the intent will be to repay bank dues in time. However, on certain things probably some relief is required. The Indian Banks’ Association has represented to RBI on these issues. So let RBI examine it and see what comes out.One of the things that the circular says is that before an account is upgraded, 20% has to be paid. I think that is a bit tough requirement. Similarly, if the account is under restructuring and even if there is a delay of one day and then the account has to be referred to NCLT within 15 days.But on the whole, I think this is a step in the right direction. But there are certain things some relaxation is warranted keeping in mind the dynamics of business. Because, at times, it happens that cash flow is temporarily disrupted, which is normal in business. Getting worried immediately because of this is not warranted. If it is persistent problem that if someone is unable to pay on a regular basis, then definitely lenders need to look at it for early resolution.It is going to be difficult for banks on account of both these reasons. But thereafter, things will start returning to normal. By April-May, all the NCLT cases of the first RBI list will have resolution. The impact will be that banks’ gross and net NPAs will start coming down. And certain portion of these assets will get a new management, so that will start become performing. You normally see a negative credit growth in first quarter, but I have a feeling that credit growth will be positive in first quarter.For SBI, our pipeline of stressed assets looks very normal. Our fresh slippages in the next financial year will not exceed 2%.There are certain sectors which are doing well. Like if infrastructure grows, then naturally cement will do well.In steel sector we have seen revival. I am told, housing sector demand is much better starting from January.Automobile sector is doing well. There are many sectors where activity is happening, but what is probably missing is large size projects by the private sector which is because of the over capacity that has been created. Going ahead, we see revival in credit growth.Also, now NCLT resolution will start happening. In many cases, we are at advanced stages of resolution. If that starts happening, then there will be working capital, investment requirements will revive demand.We expect this credit revival in one quarter. Normally, the first quarter of the current financial year is subdued in terms of loan growth, but I am expecting good activity in Q1 because of the resolution.A couple of things have been initiated. Out portfolio strategy has been reworked. April onwards, our budgeting will be risk based . Capital allocation between various business groups, more emphasis on profitability, revamped organizational structure for corporate banking group, a revamped organizational structure for stressed asset group, and roadmap for IT and digitisation will be unveiled from April 1.In our country, people are very sensitive about charges, whether it is banking service or railway ticket. As a bank, we have to take into account customer sentiment. So, there was a demand. We had said we will take into account the demand of the customers, and in response to their demand, this step has been taken.All banks have recently increased their MCLR by 15-20 bps.

14,2018-04-26," In August 2017, the Lok Sabha passed the State Banks (Repeal and Amendment) Bill of 2017 to amend the State Bank of India (SBI) Act of 1955 to remove references related to subsidiary banks.After the acquisition of subsidiary banks by the SBI, subsidiary banks have ceased to exist. Therefore, the government found it necessary to repeal the SBI (Subsidiary Banks) Act of 1959 and the State Bank of Hyderabad Act of 1956.The government has also found it unnecessary to retain certain provisions in the SBI Act, 1955, which apply to subsidiary banks. These subsidiary banks — State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, State Bank of Mysore, State Bank of Patiala, and State Bank of Travancore — were constituted under the SBI (Subsidiary Banks) Act of 1959.The State Bank of Hyderabad was originally constituted as Hyderabad State Bank under the Hyderabad State Bank Act and renamed as the State Bank of Hyderabad under sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the State Bank of Hyderabad Act of 1956.To rationalise resources, reduce costs, improve profits, for lower cost of funds leading to better rate of interest for the public, and to improve productivity and customer service, the SBI, with the sanction of the Central government and in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), entered into negotiations with the State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, the State Bank of Mysore, the State Bank of Patiala, the State Bank of Travancore and the State Bank of Hyderabad for acquiring their business, including assets and liabilities. The schemes relating to such acquisitions were agreed upon by the Central Board of the SBI and the respective boards of the subsidiary banks and approved by the RBI. In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (2) of Section 35 of the SBI Act, 1955, the Central government accorded its sanction.Accordingly, the Central government issued the following orders, sanctioning the scheme of acquisition: (a) the Acquisition of State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur Order, 2017; (b) the Acquisition of State Bank of Mysore Order, 2017; (c) the Acquisition of State Bank of Patiala Order, 2017; (d) the Acquisition of State Bank of Travancore Order, 2017; and (e) the Acquisition of State Bank of Hyderabad Order, 2017. As per these, the business of these subsidiary banks is to be carried out by the SBI in accordance with the SBI Act, 1955, with effect from April 1, 2017.

15,2018-03-12," A major portion of a State Bank of India (SBI) building was gutted in a fire outbreak early Monday. The timely intervention of the Kerala Fire and Rescue Services prevented the fire from spreading to other parts of the building and thereby, derailing the normal functioning of the bank.Fire had broke out in the Centralised Clearing Processing Cell (CCPC) of the SBI in the first floor of its branch at the Panavila junction. While the incident was reported at 4.50 a.m. by employees who turned up for work, the fire is suspected to have broken out much earlier. Four units from the Chengalchoola fire station rushed to the spot and managed to douse the fire within a little over an hour. The fire fighting operation was led by Assistant Divisional Officer Abdul Rasheed. The CCPC unit, the only centralised unit of the bank in the State to handle cheque clearances, is believed to have suffered damage worth at least ₹50 lakh, according to preliminary estimates. The short-circuit in an air-conditioner is suspected to have led to the fire outbreak. The banking hall, which had around 20 computer systems, was completely gutted in the fire. Several furniture, false ceiling and wiring were severely damaged. However, the server remained unaffected, enabling normal functioning of the CCPC from the second floor from the afternoon.A furniture shop was gutted in Aralumoodu, near Neyyattinkara, during the wee hours of the day. Four fire units from the Vizhinjam and Neyyattinkara fire stations were pressed into service to douse the fire. The cause of the fire outbreak was yet to be ascertained.

16,2018-03-23,"The State Bank of India informed the bourses on Friday about a fraud allegedly committed by the Chennai-headquartered Nathella Sampath Jewellery Private Limited (NSJPL) worth over ₹250 crore.In a filing with the Bombay Stock Exchange, the SBI said, “NSJPL, a jewellery manufacturing company, was incorporated in 2007. An aggregate limit of ₹250 crore sanctioned by the SBI in a consortium arrangement had been classified by the bank as ‘fraud’ on December 22, 2017 for having misrepresented the financial statements from 2010 and liquidated primary security.”In 2017, NSJPL was born by merging three firms run by the family — Nathella Sampath Jewellery, Nathella Sampathu Chetty (NSC) & Co and NSC Jewellers.Last year, one of the subsidiary firms brought its shutters down, citing cash crunch. The company could not pay back the money to customers who had invested in its gold chit scheme. The firm put out a notice outside its outlet on Thanikachalam Road, T. Nagar, stating that it was unable to pay dues to depositors and also sought time to return the money.Prasanna Kumar, director of Nathella, had then told The Hindu, “We are going through a tough time and our first priority is to help our customers. We just need some time.” In November 2017, the jewellery firm’s promoters admitted to the Economic Offences Wing that it owed money to more than 21,000 customers who had deposited in its gold chit scheme.Receive the best of The Hindu delivered to your inbox everyday!Please enter a valid email address.",http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/jeweller-accused-of-cheating-sbi-of-250-crore/article23337645.ece,0.06,0.038,0.902,0.555

18,2018-03-03," If the civil suit filed by the State Bank of India (SBI) in the Madras High Court is true, the makers of Tamil movie Aruva Sanda used car loans worth ₹3.44 crore obtained from the bank to produce the movie. In its suit, SBI claimed that the film’s producer and his accomplices obtained as many as 13 car loans, to the tune of ₹3.44 crore, from the bank and utilised the money to make the movie. Instead of purchasing luxury cars, they cheated the bank.The alleged fraud was committed with the connivance of one of its empanelled auto loan counsellor, who hacked into the system of the bank and made sure that the loan amounts were transferred to the personal savings bank accounts of the applicants, instead of being paid directly to automobile dealers. Claiming that the loan proceeds were re-routed from the individual bank accounts of the applicants to the savings bank account of film producer V. Esakkiraja of White Screen Productions, the bank urged the court to order that it shall have the first charge over the sale proceeds of his movie Aruva Sanda and restrain its release till the loans were repaid. Justice C.V. Karthikeyan granted an interim injunction restraining the release of the movie till March 16 and ordered notices returnable by then to the producer and his accomplices. Notice had also been ordered to the auto loan counsellor D. Chitra, who allegedly assisted the applicants to siphon off the money from the Velachery branch of SBI.Receive the best of The Hindu delivered to your inbox everyday!Please enter a valid email address.

19,2018-06-02,"A 40-year-old housewife from Darave village in Seawood lost ₹6.98 lakh after sharing her OTP (one-time password) 28 times with a cyberfraud.The incident happened between May 17 and 23 when she received a call from a fraudster claiming to be manager of the State Bank of India.“The fraudster told the lady that he was from SBI and that her ATM card was blocked. He asked her to share her ATM card details and pin number to unblock the card. He called her again asking to share the OTP number that she received. He also told her to delete any other message from the bank,” Police Inspector (Crime) Bhaguji Auti said.According to the police, the accused’s first transaction was of ₹4,000 to an Oxigen wallet in Gurgaon. After realising that the woman was not suspicious, the caller made many calls on a daily basis till May 23.“The lowest amount of transaction was of ₹4,000 and the highest ₹49,999 to a PhonePe wallet in Mumbai. In all, he made 28 transactions,” Mr. Auti said.Since the accused asked the woman to delete the messages from the bank, she kept deleting updates on the amount deduction.She finally learnt about the fraud on Wednesday when she went to update her passbook.“She found that nobody from the bank had called her. She lodged a complaint with us when she learnt of the cheating,” Mr. Auti said. The woman’s husband works in Kuwait, while she stays with her two sons in Darave. Her elder son has just finished Class XII and the ₹10 lakh in her account was an education loan meant for his higher studies.“The family is shattered. Her husband is in touch with the investigating team. The woman says she doesn’t have knowledge of online banking,” Mr. Auti said.“We have asked the SBI to send messages and alert every customer visiting the bank that no details about ATM card or OTP should be shared with anyone,” he added.Receive the best of The Hindu delivered to your inbox everyday!Please enter a valid email address.",http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/698-lakh-lost-by-sharing-otp-28-times/article24069504.ece,0.058,0.077,0.865,-0.8435

21,2018-04-10,"Banks in Telangana continue to grapple with cash crunch as the State government gets ready to roll out a one of its kind, ₹4,000 per acre investment support scheme for farmers, every crop season, next month.The government’s decision to hand out the cheques comes even as thousands of bank customers increasingly find, much to their dismay, that there just isn’t enough cash at the ATMs at all times. It is no different at the counters managed by tellers either, says a regional rural bank head, requesting anonymity, on the cash levels at the bank branches. Deterioration in cash availability began from September last year, State Bank of India (SBI) sources say, about the challenge banks in Telangana as well as neighbouring Andhra Pradesh are facing.Specific to Telangana, information on cash supplied to currency chests obtained under RTI Act 2005 recently from SBI by ‘Factly’, a data-driven fact finding portal, sheds more light. Factly founder Rakesh Dubbudu had also sought details from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on supplies it made day wise to all currency chests in Telangana for the same time frame – January 2016 to January 2018. The central bank, however, turned down the request citing a provision under the Act. An analysis of the cash received by eight facilities of SBI — the SCAB (specialised currency administration branch) in Hyderabad and currency chest branches in seven other major districts — shows the monthly average supply has dwindled to ₹629 crore in the five months ended January. During a 10-month period from November 2016 (demonetisation period) to August 2017, the monthly average supply was ₹1,795 crore. This number stood at ₹1,316 crore in January-October 2016 (pre-demonetisation) period. During the 25 months for which data was provided, the supplies touched a peak of ₹5,377 crore in July last year. At the other end of the spectrum, the supply was nil in September 2016. High value currency dominated the supplies all months, except in November 2017 when all of the ₹544 crore supplied was in low value currency notes. Mr. Dubbudu says these numbers can be extrapolated to get the big picture. According to sources in banking industry, SBI usually gets a 40% share in every cash remittance made by RBI in Telangana. A portion of the cash some of the eight SBI facilities received was also meant for onward distribution to other banks. “It is because currency supply is limited post demonetisation,” an SBI official sought to attribute the crunch. This in spite of RBI replenishing the currency, withdrawn following the November 8, 2016 demonetisation directive, in terms of value. Earlier this year, State Finance Minister Eatala Rajender and Agriculture Minister Pocharam Srinivas Reddy had met Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and appealed for adequate currency notes to be made available in the banks in view of upcoming scheme for farmers.So what fate await the cheques? None of them will be dishonoured, a banker assures, hastening to add: “The money will come into their (farmers) accounts.” What he, however, did not explain was how soon can it be withdrawn.

23,2018-05-10,"The State government has accused commercial banks for asking higher margin requirements from first generation entrepreneurs, particularly those in the food processing industry, and termed the lenders as ‘non-supportive’.In a letter to the state level bankers’ committee (SLBC), Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said banks and financial institutions are refusing “legitimate requirements of additional finance to new entrepreneurs”.In the letter, the Chief Minister said the lenders are creating hurdles by insisting high credit margins up to 40% on the basis of external ratings and without considering farm land as a collateral, especially in the case of the agricultural and food processing industry. The agricultural and food processing industry contributed 14% to the national Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Mr. Fadnavis said in his letter.The Chief Minister said bankers have the perception that first generation entrepreneurs have no experience despite them having farming background. “Most of the agro processing entrepreneurs are educated and have a farming background. There is a difference between lack of knowledge and lack of experience. Bankers are hesitant to provide the finance to first generation entrepreneurs with a perception he has no experience by ignoring the value of knowledge he has,” the Chief Minister said. “Most of the agro processing units in the state are underfinanced by bank officials, who have correlated the financing to their targets and sanctioning powers,” he said.Mr. Fadnavis went on to cite an example of a agro-processing project, located 300 km from Mumbai, to which interests of 19 villages and 1,251 farmers are linked.The letter said the project was approved by the State on October 23, 2015, and sought credit of ₹9 crore from the State Bank of India (SBI). But SBI insisted a 200% urban collateral securities, and ignored its own techno economic viability (TEV) study to extend just ₹4.75 crore as a term loan and another ₹25 lakh as cash credit.“Since the last 18 months from the last disbursement, the project could not start its commercial operations due to under financing by the bank despite Maharashtra government support under the Public- Private Partnership for Integrated Agriculture Development scheme. The company lost two crushing seasons due to this,” a report prepared by the State Industries Department said.The Chief Minister has now asked the banks to ensure that their sanctioning authorities acquire core domain knowledge of the farm sector, consider agriculture land as collateral, set up an apex body in banks with knowledge for conducting TEV studies, relaxing margins for food processing units, provide interest subvention regularly, among others.The State government has communicated to the banks through a notification issued on April 27 and May 4 to remove certification hurdles for industry seeking credit extension. However, the guidelines are yet to be implemented by the banks, state government officials said.

24,2018-02-17,"The rationalisation of branches of State Bank of India (SBI) following merger into five of its associate banks in April last year has almost been completed in Telangana, at least for this financial year, wherever they were located in close proximity to each other.Sources in the SBI said about 125 branches were relocated and staff redeployed in six phases till this week. The relocation was either way—branches of erstwhile associate banks shifting to the premises of SBI branches or vice versa—on the basis of various parameters. “We looked at what was economical to the bank, customer convenience, parking, rentals and several other factors before initiating the process,” a senior official said. The SBI had a branch network of 500 and the State Bank of Hyderabad, the largest among the associate banks in Telangana, 850 before the merger. A few other branches of four other associate banks — State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, State Bank of Patiala, State Bank of Travancore and State Bank of Mysore — were also absorbed in nearby branches of the group. Interestingly, a branch of SBH was merged with Bharatiya Mahila Bank which was also included in the scheme at Mahabubnagar.The branch and IFSC codes also underwent changes after the shifting. The accounts were also transferred to the new branches and treated as “home” accounts. The rationalisation of branches was a seamless affair as there were no major protests anywhere barring complaints by customers that they were not informed well in advance. The customers were directed by phone messages to visit nearby SBI branches to carry out transactions henceforth. The complaints by customers, particularly with women and elderly, were mainly about having to walk the extra distance to reach the bank. The deadline for rationalisation was actually set for September last and redeployment of officers and staff was December. But, it continued till now as the shifting could only happen on second and fourth Saturdays and Sundays which were bank holidays, the official said. He added that there will not be any more rationalisation till March end because of annual closure of accounts and subsequent audit.

25,2018-04-09," The days of demonetisation seem to have returned with a majority of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) going dry in the State. Downed shutters and ‘no cash’ and ‘out of service’ signs have become a common sight.The bankers, too, admit that there is a cash crunch. They, however, refuse to divulge the reasons and are tight-lipped on despatches from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). “The RBI is not sharing any information with us,” says a senior banker, who didn’t want to be quoted. Though the banks are receiving cash, the despatches are not sufficient to meet the demand. “The cash being received from the RBI does not even meet half our requirement. This apart, deposits by customers have dropped drastically and the withdrawal of FDs and other deposits has gone up like never before,” he says. At many places, people were seen rushing from ATM to ATM to withdraw money. A. Narasimha Rao, a senior citizen, has been scouting for an ATM which is dispensing cash. The ATM he frequents close to his residence on Pantakaluva Road has been sporting the ‘no cash’ sign for quite some time. Also, none of the ATMs on Bandar Road was functioning on Monday. “I have been facing this problem for the past few days. The ATMs are not being replenished regularly,” he laments. Not more than 40% ATMs in the State are dispensing cash. There are about 8,900 ATMs in the State and the dysfunctional ATMs varied from 15 to 80% depending upon the bank. The ATMs of the State Bank of India (SBI), the biggest bank in the country, have also gone dry. SBI senior official Deep Chand says that 15% of the ATMs were dysfunctional. “There is a cash problem. We are trying to replenish the ATMs at regular intervals,” he says. Andhra Bank Circle General Manager K.S.D. Siva Vara Prasad, who is also convener of State Level Bankers Committee (SLBC) Andhra Pradesh, says that the problem is acute in places such as Visakhapatnam, Chittoor, and Vijayawada. The banks are sending requests to the RBI regularly and efforts are being made to ease the situation, he says. People seem to have developed reservations about parking their money in banks in the light of the proposed Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance Bill and banking scams.The Union Finance Ministry too conducted a video conference with top bankers in the State a week ago and asked them to create awareness among the public on the FRDI and cash availability, bankers say.Receive the best of The Hindu delivered to your inbox everyday!Please enter a valid email address.",http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/unease-deepens-as-atms-go-dry-yet-again-in-state/article23485354.ece,0.039,0.041,0.92,-0.4402
26,2018-03-04,"  MADURAIThe advent of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) in the city was considered a boon to bank customers. Initially, entry was restricted. Watchmen guarded them. The place was clean. There was no limit on the number of withdrawals. And the service was free. Now, the doors are wide open. Air-conditioning units do not function. Watchmen have vanished from many ATM kiosks. Some ATMs do not provide transaction slips. Some are littered with slips. Withdrawals are restricted. Charges are levied for excess withdrawals. And an annual fee is deducted from accounts.Some ATMs do not function at all while some work for a few hours or days. Some display ‘no cash’ boards. Some do not dispense cash but deduct money from your account. The customer has to complain and wait for a week to get back the money. Some deliver only ₹100 notes. Though a customer can withdraw ₹40,000 to ₹50,000 a day, he has to do it multiple times, and in the process he exhausts free transaction limits. No machine in Madurai dispenses ₹200 notes, though officials claim that they are calibrated for the purpose. Gullible customers have to guard against conmen who pretend to help them at ATMs but swap the actual cards with fake ones. Smart people have to deal with phishing, fraudulent phone calls and cloning of debit cards. Cash withdrawal during late night hours is also not advisable. The ATMs seem to have lost their sheen under these circumstances. For, online banking or Point of Sale (PoS) machines kept in all kinds of shops, textile showrooms, petrol bunks, theatres and restaurants come in handy for making payments. These machines are used for goods delivered at home for orders placed over phone or through e-commerce portals. Banks have introduced mobile wallets. Apps help people book train, bus or flight tickets; recharge prepaid mobile phones or DTH, pay postpaid phone/ electricity bills, call taxi charges and settle money for goods bought in stores. Free credit cards are available but some people do not prefer them. Cash-back, reward points, discounts or gift vouchers attract people towards digital payments. Cash handling charges beyond a limit in some banks too push people to go digital. A HDFC official says the bank accepts either cheque or online payment for housing loan dues but not cash. However, digital transactions have a long way to go as the technology is yet to percolate down to rural areas, says a top Canara Bank officer. Bose, a pensioner, and M. Sankar, a farmer, say the limit on free transactions hurts them a lot. A. Paulraj Sekar, a Western music teacher of Tirunagar, and Rathinavel, a civil contractor, say they can’t help but accept deduction of charges beyond free transactions. B. Singaravelu, Superintendent, Public Works Department, says the ATM of City Union Bank near his office at Tallakulam did not dispense cash but money got debited from his account in the SBI, along with charges, when he attempted withdrawal a few days back. K. Ganesan, a businessman, says private sector banks maintain their ATMs better than public sector ones and terms Swachh Bharat Abhiyan campaign a humbug, as far as the ATMs are concerned. S. Samuel, Manager (alternate channel), SBI, asserts that 93% their ATMs are functioning at all times, which is on a par with national average. The ATMs in remote locations go dry in the first few days of every month because they are filled with cash only once in a day. He terms the absence of watchmen in off-site ATMs a policy decision and asserts that the ATMs are equipped with CCTV cameras to take care of untoward incidents. “We keep track of all the ATMs,” he says, and blames private agencies for poor maintenance of select ATMs. Officials deplore that they do not get adequate currency notes in the denomination of ₹2,000 and ₹200 from the RBI. Notes dispensed by the ATMs too do not come back to banks. There is also no big encouragement for online transactions.

27,2018-01-27," The Madras High Court has discharged a former State Bank of India (SBI) clerk from two cases booked against him on charges of manipulating bank records besides fabricating telex messages purportedly issued by its New York branch and getting hundreds of dollars transferred to the bank accounts of his wife and another individual.Justice G. Jayachandran discharged M. Murugappan from the two cases on the ground that he had already been convicted by a trial court in a related case, an appeal against which was pending in the High Court, and therefore prosecuting him with respect to two other transactions related to the first case would amount to double jeopardy.According to the prosecution, the petitioner was serving as a clerk in the Ambattur Industrial Estate branch of SBI in 1996-97 when the alleged crime took place. As per a complaint lodged by the then assistant general manager of the bank, the petitioner duped some of the customers of the bank and carried out the illegal transactions. He submitted fake telex messages reportedly issued by SBI’s New York branch and got nearly $14,000 transferred to his wife’s savings bank account. Similarly, he created fabricated telex messages and got $8,145 transferred to the Non Resident External (NRE) account of a person named Kannappan.Though the cause of action in all three transactions were the same and the witnesses were also the same, the CBI had filed a final report in 2001 in one of the three cases. The chargesheets in the other two cases were filed a couple of years later.During the trial proceedings in the first case, the petitioner moved an application before the special court for CBI cases with a plea to try the other two cases also along with the first one. However, the special court refused to accept the plea since as many as 20 witnesses had already been examined in the first case.Since clubbing the other cases with the first one would require recalling all those witnesses and re-examining them, the trial court declined the request for a joint trial. It also dismissed the petitions filed by the accused to discharge him from the other two cases, and hence the present revision petition.Receive the best of The Hindu delivered to your inbox everyday!Please enter a valid email address.

28,2018-03-30,"Ending months of uncertainty, the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) entered into an agreement with a consortium of banks led by the State Bank of India (SBI) for a Rs. 3,100-crore long-term loan to restructure its Rs. 3,117-crore loan liability and to overcome financial crisis.The agreement was signed on Thursday at Transport Bhavan, headquarters of the KSRTC, by Chairman and Managing Director A. Hemachandran and managers of the banks in the presence of Transport Secretary K. R. Jyothilal.Under the pact, the SBI will give Rs. 1,000 crore, Canara Bank and Vijaya Bank Rs. 500 crore each, and Kerala Transport Development Finance Corporation (KTDFC) Rs. 1,100 crore. The loan is for 20 years and the interest is 9.2 % for SBI, Canara and Vijaya Bank. The interest for the loan being availed from the KTDFC is 11.8 % and the difference is to be paid by government.The KTDFC was roped into the consortium after over half-a-dozen banks that had expressed interest backed out citing one reason or the other.

30,2018-02-21,"The adoption of blockchain by India’s banks could help avert frauds such as the one at Punjab National Bank as the disaggregated and transparent nature of the technology, which updates information across all users simultaneously, would have ensured that various officials would have instantly been alerted to the creation of the letters of undertaking (LoUs), according to bankers and blockchain specialists.“Transaction reconciliation systems at present do not result in immediate notification,” Mrutyunjay Mahapatra, Deputy Managing Director and Chief Information Officer at State Bank of India, told The Hindu. “Using blockchain, all parties on the chain will be immediately notified about a transaction.”Blockchain, a distributed ledger technology originally developed as an accounting system for the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, is being researched across the banking and financial services industries for the potential benefits it may offer in an increasingly digitised business environment. Central banks including the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Reserve Bank of India have been examining the technology to understand the regulatory challenges it may pose.“Blockchain potentially has far-reaching implications for the financial sector, and this is prompting more and more banks, insurers and other financial institutions to invest in research into potential applications of this technology,” the RBI’s Working Group on FinTech and Digital Banking said in a report. “Market participants in other securities markets are exploring the usage of blockchain or distributed database technology to provide various services such as clearing and settlement, trading,” the report noted. “Indian securities market may also see such developments in the near future and, therefore, there is a need to understand the benefits, risks and challenges such developments may pose.”SBI was convinced of blockchain’s utility, especially its potential to improve internal fraud monitoring, and had already implemented it in its reconciliation systems and in several cross-country payment gateways, according to Mr. Mahapatra. “In blockchain, from the source system it will try to match the transactions, so one can immediately verify any transaction using blockchain.”Suveer Kumar Gupta, CEO of Shivalik Mercantile Cooperative Bank said blockchain would ensure easy tracking of entries.“If the LoUs were on the blockhain, then they would have been there for everybody to see, and every entry into the chain leaves a clear record of who made that entry, and where.”Blockchains, Mr Gupta explained, are immutable and distributed ledgers, which means that anything recorded on them cannot be changed or deleted, and is instantly uploaded to all users on that blockchain.  “If my bank wants to lend to a borrower, I need to know what all he has borrowed from other institutions as well. For that, we have the CIBIL score at present, but that data is prone to human error.”However, Mr. Mahapatra pointed out that simply depending on technology to prevent frauds is fraught, since they take place at the human level, where an official with the correct authentication can misuse the system.“The modus operandi of the fraud as it appears right now is that somebody used all the authentication methods and it was compromised at the user level,” Mr. Mahapatra said. “If that is the case, then any technology can be hoodwinked. Here, what was given into the system is not in doubt, the one who gave it into the system is in doubt.”Still, blockchain’s technology is such that even human error can be greatly mitigated, Kartik Mandaville, CEO of SpringRole, a blockchain solutions company said. “Blockchain can fix this by having everything linked to the same database.”“The Core Banking Solution is definitely a good first step, and this is why something like this fraud could not have happened in SBI, because everything is linked to the core system, even the foreign banking system. In PNB, the SWIFT system was not connected to CBS.” “Blockchain takes this one step further towards a decentralised system where you need multiple branches to give their approval before any sort of transaction is approved or an LoU is issued,” Mr. Mandaville added. Another big challenge that blockchain can address is providing a basis for the trust banks have in each other, thereby preventing such frauds from taking place.“Another big challenge is the trust between banks,” Mr. Gupta said. “I trust that, say, ICICI Bank is giving correct information only because we feel that we should trust each other. There is no tangible backing of that trust. Once blockchain comes in, that trust will be backed up by clear tangible proof.” “For example, Axis Bank in Hong Kong gave loans to Nirav Modi only because they trusted what was coming from PNB Mumbai,” Mr. Gupta added. “Had it been on blockchain, those clear entries would have been there that show whether the information is correct or not. That is one way such frauds can be prevented.”“Blockchain is not a panacea for all issues facing the banking system today,” said Jesse Chenard, Founder and CEO of Monetago, a blockchain company that works closely with financial institutions. “However, blockchain is an ideal technology to ensure proof of integrity to the data and reduce incidents of fraud.”Receive the best of The Hindu delivered to your inbox everyday!Please enter a valid email address.",http://www.thehindu.com/business/blockchain-tech-could-help-prevent-frauds-like-at-pnb/article22818844.ece,0.128,0.041,0.831,0.997
31,2018-03-10,"Hill County Properties Limited, formerly known as Maytas Properties Limited, has been directed to pay compensation of ₹1 lakh apart from refunding money to a petitioner, who had complained of deficiency in service.The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum of Telangana was dealing with a complaint filed by Kukatpally resident Dr. K. Sudhakar (49).The complainant contended that he had obtained a loan from the State Bank of India (SBI) and paid ₹ 43,76,00 for a flat in Hill County township. However, till the time of moving the Commission, the construction was incomplete, Dr. Sudhakar alleged, seeking a refund and penalisation of SBI for releasing large amounts to the company without verifying the status of the project.While the counsel for Hill County said that the apartment construction is now complete, the Commission noted that it was not the case when Dr. Sudhakar sought the termination of the agreement. The commission also said that it was unjust that the complainant continue to pay the EMI for the apartment.“The monies paid by the complainant are lying with the opposite party 1, which is nothing but debt repayable to the complainant,” an excerpt from the judgment reads. The commission also said that the rules of limitation, which were invoked by the counsel for Hill County, are not meant to destroy the right of parties.Coming down heavily on SBI, which is the second respondent, the Commission noted, “The bank has undoubtedly violated the terms of the tripartite agreement, and released the amount without bothering to verify as to the stage and nature of construction. In other words, the bank financed a non-existent project or incomplete project, duping its own customer.” It also said both parties have shown deficiency in service and unfair trade practices.Apart from refund and compensation to the petitioner, the Commission directed Hill County to refund the amount it had received from SBI.Receive the best of The Hindu delivered to your inbox everyday!Please enter a valid email address.",http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/1-lakh-fine-slapped-on-hyderabad-property-firm/article23037060.ece,0.077,0.084,0.839,0.794

35,2018-03-12," The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Monday registered a case of alleged hacking of a foreign travel card database and 374 unauthorised online transactions involving $1.41 million through three prepaid cards issued by the State Bank of India (SBI).The FIR names one Sandeep Kumar Poojary, to whom the prepaid cards were issued. The primary card had an upper limit of only $200. The accused is an on-site resource of Yalamanchili Software operations team, which provides the prepaid card application. More persons are suspected to be involved in the case registered under various provisions of the IPC and the IT Act. The SBI, in its complaint, said manpower resources for handling the system operations was also provided by Yalamanchili Software, while database support resources were extended by IT services company MPhasis. On February 28 last year, Yalamanchili Software’s COO reported the incident to the bank, stating that the balance in the prepaid card system had been altered fraudulently for authorisation of three foreign travel cards belonging to a single user. The authorisation had mainly happened over e-commerce websites of four merchants: Neteller.com, Entropay, Swiftvoucher and Skrill.com. These transactions were carried out from November 8, 2016, to February 12, 2017. The primary card was issued by the bank’s NRI Seawoods branch in Navi Mumbai on November 7, 2016. Two more add-ons were issued to the user on November 29 and December 7, 2016, by the same branch.All the merchant transactions came via VISA with the merchant country code as Great Britain, and the transaction and billing currency as U.S. dollars, according to the FIR.Yalamanchili Software Exports told the bank that while the transactions happened on the prepaid card system, the balance appeared to have been altered manually via the Oracle Database access. Post authorisation, settlement transactions and authorisation were deleted, and also the general ledger entry.Therefore, the balance sheet generated on the prepaid card system did not show any difference.After the cheating was detected, SBI blocked the three cards, barred users from transacting on the four merchant sites, and revoked the privilege of application user for executing database package, said the bank.Receive the best of The Hindu delivered to your inbox everyday!Please enter a valid email address.

43,2018-02-16,"State Bank of India (SBI) has an exposure of $212 million linked to the fraud perpetrated at Punjab National Bank (PNB), SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar said, adding that the exposure was mainly to PNB and that he did not see any liabilities accruing to SBI as a consequence of the fraud.“We do not have exposure to (Nirav) Modi. My exposure is to PNB,” Mr. Kumar told mediapersons before inaugurating the Global NRI Center at Kochi on Friday. “We are not worried... the regulator is there, judicial system is there... there is also a categorical statement by the MD of PNB, that all bonafide transactions... they will honour. This is something which will get sorted out between the banks.” 　PNB, India’s second-largest lender, was defrauded of ₹11,500 crore through issuances of letters of undertaking (LoUs) in a scam whose dimensions are still unfolding. 　Speaking on the sidelines of the press meet, Mr. Kumar said of the SBI group’s $212 million exposure to PNB — connected with the LoU transactions initiated on behalf of firms controlled by Nirav Modi — $90 million was made through SBI’s Mauritius subsidiary. “There has been absolutely no slip up or lapse from our side. We have followed standard operating procedure in this regard.” He added that the bank was “100% confident” of recovering the amount.Mr. Kumar also separately said SBI had “a small exposure to Gitanjali Gems,” without providing additional details on the nature or extent of that exposure. 　　　He also said that SBI’s exposure to the gems and jewellery industry was less than 1% of the total domestic loan book.“My domestic loan book is ₹16 lakh crore and gems and jewellery sector exposure is less than 1%,” he said.The SBI chief observed that risk management in banks was a continuous process.“We have to keep updating it. Operational risk is unknown, while credit risk is a calculated risk. In operational risk —what hits and when, is unpredictable. The question is what to do when every level of security is breached. That is unfortunate. 　“We have to constantly review, upgrade, look for gaps in processes, compliance standards, effectiveness of audit systems... Banking is a complex business. Volumes are large. Risk culture, compliance culture all need to be good.”　Asked about the impact of recent RBI norms to accelerate recognition of bad loans and initiation of insolvency proceedings he said, “Guidelines have made it easier... there are two key elements to the new norms: whatever the bank feels is sustainable debt needs a rating; two, unless you get back 20% in payment, you can’t upgrade the asset.”　Asked if this would add to the bank’s provisioning burden, he said, “It would not make much of an impact.” He added that exact numbers were being worked out on the nature of the impact.　Mr. Kumar said, “It is important that there are adequate number of benches at the NCLT.” A majority of insolvency cases, taken to the NCLT in the first list shared by the RBI, would likely see completion by the first quarter of FY19, he added.　Recognition of stressed loans at SBI was ‘almost over’, the chairman said adding, “From next year onwards, 2018-19, we will enter into what I call the normal position. Normal for me is 2% or below on gross fresh slippages.”　On additional capital that the government is set to provide public sector banks, he said the amount accruing to SBI would be meant for growth and expansion. “We will raise ₹20,000 crore from the market. The recap amount of ₹8,800 crore is towards growth. It is not needed for provisioning.” 　SBI would also look to monetise some of its non-banking assets by FY20. “FY2018-19 will see no IPO from us. The year after, ie FY20, we will go for IPO [of some of our assets], because we believe we can add lot more value before going for IPO. Three companies are prime candidates for the IPO — SBI MF, SBI General, SBI Card.”Earlier, the bank unveiled its Global NRI Center to help centralise NRI operations for the bank across the country. The centre is meant to be a single-point of contact for all NRI banking related services. To further enhance the experience for its 33 lakh NRI customers, SBI also introduced services such as wealth management, SBI Intelligent Assist, free post box service, SBI Mingle and a remittance facility for U.S.-based customers.　As of January 2018, the bank had an NRI deposit base of ₹1.95 lakh crore.Asked if interest rates, especially or home loans, would start moving upward after a period that saw declines, he said, “There is no scope for bringing it down further. Whether it will go up or not, we will review the position when our asset liability committee meets this month.”　SBI had merged 5 of its associate banks and Bharat Mahila Bank with itself earlier this financial year. Following the merger, Mr. Kumar said, the branch rationalisation process was ‘almost complete’. “We rationalised about 1,600 branches.” He added that headcount since the merger had dropped from 2.78 lakh to 2.65 lakh currently. “About 3,500 employees opted for the voluntary retirement scheme that was offered. The remaining reached the age of superannuation.”　On the changes to the minimum account balance that customers are required to maintain, he said that a review was going on for the rules determining balance effective April 1. “Monthly average balance requirements may remain the same. Anyway our charges are amongst the lowest.” He highlighted the fact that SBI had 14 crore accounts that were Basic Savings Bank Deposit accounts which attracted no penalties. “A normal savings bank account yields us no more than ₹120 a year. If that customer does 5 transactions in a month using the SBI debit card but in another bank’s ATM, our outgo is ₹1,080 a year. Look at the comparison.”He added that he expected growth in the infrastructure sector to pick up in fiscal 2018-19. “Things will improve in the roads sector and in renewables. Government spends are increasing.”　(With inputs from G. Krishnakumar.

45,2018-05-22,"State Bank of India (SBI), the country’s largest lender, posted it’s highest ever loss in the fourth quarter — of ₹7,718 crore due to provisions made for losses in its bond portfolio and for bad loans.This the second consecutive quarter that the lender has made a loss. In the Oct-Dec quarter, the bank made a loss of ₹2,416 crore while during the fourth quarter of the previous financial year, the loss was ₹3,442 crore. The numbers are not exactly comparable on a year-on-year basis, since the lender merged all its five associate banks and Bharatiya Mahila Bank at the beginning of 2017-18.The bank has made ₹24,080 crore provision for bad loans and ₹4,761 crore for investments, mainly in its bond portfolio.“Let me confirm that the recognition [of bad loans] is completed,” SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar said at the press conference.He pointed to the ‘strength’ of the balance sheet as the loan loss coverage ratio improved by almost 500 basis points to 50.38% in one year. “Our capital position is also strong,” he said. The bank’s capital adequacy ratio was 12.6% as on March 31, including tier-I capital of 10.36%.The other reason for the bank’s confidence in improving its performance is that the resolution of stressed assets has started, resulting in banks recovering loans, albeit after taking deep haircuts.Last week, lenders successfully sold Bhushan Steel — that was referred for bankruptcy following default — to Tata Steel. The SBI has recovered 72% of the loans given to the steel company from the sale.The SBI has an exposure of ₹49,116 crore for the 12 companies against which bankruptcy proceedings were initiated by banks, after being identified by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for action under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. The SBI has made a provision of 56% on these accounts and expects to take 52% on these accounts, Mr. Kumar said.There was also a second list of accounts, where SBI has an exposure of ₹28,510 crore and has made 63% provisioning. However, proportion of haircut from these accounts are expected to be higher, a bank official said.The SBI expects resolution of the first list of accounts that was referred to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) by the end of September, and for the second list by the end of the financial year.“Resolution of NCLT accounts will lead to lower GNPAs, in addition to better margins,” the bank said in a presentation to the investors.Shares of SBI rose 3.7% to close at ₹254.15 on the BSE, while the overall indices ended almost flat.“Last year [2017-18] was disappointing. There is hope this year. FY20 will happiness,” Mr. Kumar said indication that a real turn around for the bank would start from the next financial year.The SBI reported a gross NPA of 10.91% at the end of March which is 56 bps higher than the preceding quarter. It aims to bring down gross NPA below 6% by March 2020.During the period under review, ₹29,037 crore worth loans slipped into the NPA category, of which ₹17,435 crore was from stressed standard asset category. SBI has classified telecom player Aircel as NPA and has provided 50% of its exposure after the company filed for bankruptcy.Going ahead, the SBI said it has redefined the segment that lends to large corporates which will now comprise of only AA rated companies. The lender expected loan growth to be 10% and deposit growth of 9% this fiscal. It is also planning to divest a stake in the merchant banking arm — SBI Caps — by roping in a partner and is looking to sell between 26-49%.Receive the best of The Hindu delivered to your inbox everyday!Please enter a valid email address.",http://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/sbi-posts-q4-net-loss-of-7718-crores/article23958557.ece,0.052,0.064,0.883,-0.7712

Venugopal Dhoot
, chairman of the consumer durable-to-oil conglomerate Videocon Industries, has asserted that his firm got no favours from the Chanda Kochhar-led ICICI Bank, nor did he extend any favours to Deepak Kochhar, the banker’s husband, as has been alleged. Mr. Dhoot’s plans to venture into the oil, gas and telecom businesses have come undone, leading to large loans becoming non-performing assets (NPA). He conceded that Videocon’s strategy of diversifying from its core business had backfired.
Please clarify your stand on extending favours to Deepak Kochhar for taking loans from ICICI Bank, where his wife Chanda Kochhar is the Managing Director and CEO.ICICI Bank has already clarified that I have not been given any favour as I have not received a loan from ICICI [Bank] alone — Videocon Industries took loans from a consortium led by the State Bank of India. This was done after a high degree of credit appraisal by the bankers as they found Videocon to be a very lucrative investment because of its oil assets. When the matter came to the [ICICI Bank] Board, Chanda Kochhar was not the Chairperson but one of the members [of the committee].Till the time the matter comes to the Board, Chanda Kochhar did not know which proposal was coming. So she could not have influenced it. I have not invested Rs. 64 crore in NuPower nor issued any money to Deepak Kochhar. Then where is the question of any
quid pro quo
?Why do you think the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has initiated a preliminary enquiry into alleged irregularities by ICICI Bank in extending loans to Videocon Industries? Some bank officials have already been examined.I don’t want to comment on this issue.Why do you think this entire controversy has started now?You must know that a Rs. 660 crore loan was given to Tuskar Overseas Inc., a group company of Videocon, 12 years ago, by the then Managing Director, and not by Ms. Chanda Kochhar. This loan of Rs. 660 core was paid back without any default.Further, a show-cause notice was issued by the Enforcement Directorate to Videocon and we won the case [where it was held] that there had been no violation of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) by Videocon.So, how can you link this old issue with the alleged controversy? It seems to be the work of some vested interest.The government has decided to bar 91 bank loan defaulters from leaving India. It is said that you may be on that list...My name doesn’t feature on this 91 defaulters’ list. It only has the names of wilful defaulters and I am not among wilful defaulters. I have not gone overseas in the past five years.My passport has already expired last year and I have not renewed it yet. If I don’t have a passport, then where is the question of flying abroad?How do you propose to repay the Videocon Group’s domestic loans of over Rs. 21,000 crore due to banks?Videocon Industries had taken a loan from ICICI Bank in 2011-12 and all the interest commitments were serviced till 2017. I agree some of the interest payments are due but we have Rs. 40,000 crore of oil assets to take care of that. We are looking at monetising some parts of the oil assets to repay our debts and the bankers are okay with it.Are any discussions under way, with possible buyers selling those oil assets?We are in talks with global oil majors of the likes of Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon-Mobil to partly sell our oil assets to retire debts. Oil prices have increased to $71 a barrel and are projected to go above $90 a barrel. It will increase the valuation of our oil assets.Do you believe that your strategy of diversifying from your core business of consumer electronics to oil and telecom has backfired on the Group?",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/we-got-loans-from-a-consortium-led-by-sbi/article23404791.ece,0.09,0.017,0.893,0.9906

According to APGVB branch manager B. Madhu, the bank never had a cash van.They used a cash van only when large sums were brought from Hyderabad. “We didn’t want to delay the distribution, hence speeded up the process,” he added.SBI chief manager B.P. Shiva Kumar said his officials ensured that escort security personnel were present before the cash was handed over. “When such large amounts are transported, cash security van is not required as long as armed guards are present,” he said.Town’s Circle Inspector Basha opined that the three armed constables were not sufficient, as the contingent risk was too high.

48,2018-05-25," The Enforcement Directorate (ED) Chennai on Friday arrested Bhoopesh Kumar Jain, the managing director of Kanishk Gold Private Limited (KPGL) for alleged money laundering. He was produced before a metropolitan magistrate court and remanded in judicial custody till June 8.According to the ED, it was felt he could try to tamper with evidence and records “to manipulate the facts in favour of his cause.” The agency added Mr. Jain, booked under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, had not cooperated with the investigation or revealed any information so far.The CBI Bank Security and Fraud Cell had registered a case against Mr. Jain on charges of forgery, cheating and criminal conspiracy levelled against him by the General Manager of State Bank of India (SBI), Chennai. The complaint alleged that he had obtained huge loans from a consortium of 14 banks with SBI as the lead bank, for business purposes. Credit facilities are usually secured against raw materials, semi finished goods, finished goods, stores, spares and stocks. However it came to light that stock statements were fudged with the help of charted accountants. On inspection by the banks in May 2017, it was found that no stocks were there and effectively all operations of KPGL had come to a standstill.According to ED, the total loss caused to the banks due to the fraud was around ₹824 crore as of December 2017.In April, the ED froze land, building, plant and machinery worth ₹48 crore belonging to the company’s owners. They also attached fixed deposits worth ₹143 crore (along with interest accrued) .The cumulative value of the properties frozen/attached was ₹191 crore.KGPL is a Chennai-based jewellery manufacturer, engaged in the business of manufacturing of gold jewellery which was marketed under the brand name ‘KRIZZ’.Receive the best of The Hindu delivered to your inbox everyday!Please enter a valid email address.

55,2018-05-28," States have the leeway to cut petrol prices by ₹ 2.65 a litre and diesel by ₹ 2 a litre without any impact to their fiscal position, research arm of State Bank of India said.“Our analysis shows that at the current crude prices, and extending our analysis to 19 states (overall consumption share is 93% both in petrol and diesel), the states could have gained at least an additional ₹ 18,728 crore of revenue, based on an average crude oil basket of around $72 / barrel for FY19,” SBI Research said in a report.This translated into an additional revenue of ₹ 2,675 crore over and above the budget estimates of States revenue for every $1/ barrel increase in oil prices, it added.The research arm said that these revenue, if foregone, would not impact states fiscal position. “We estimate that, on an average, states can cut petrol prices by ₹2.65 /litre and diesel by ₹ 2/ litre, if the entire revenue gain was to be neutralised. This is the most plausible scenario under the current circumstances,” it added. SBI Research noted that one suggestion to further rationalise the petrol and diesel prices was to consider a pricing mechanism where value added tax was imposed on base price only by states and not on prices inclusive of Centre’s tax.“If this was the case, diesel prices could further reduce by ₹3.75 /litre and petrol prices by ₹5.75/ litre. However, if this was to happen, the State will have to forego ₹ 34,627 crore of tax revenue / 0.2% of consolidated fiscal deficit of states. This will be a permanent loss of revenue to states,” it added.The firm said Centre charges a fixed excise duty of ₹19.48 per litre on petrol and ₹15.33 per litre on diesel. However, a big part of the price rise comes from the State side, it added.If the Centre cuts the excise by Re 1, the loss of revenue would be to the tune of ₹ 10,725 crore for every Re 1 cut in Central Excise and the amount will become twice if it cuts the excise duty by ₹2. This would push up the deficit of Centre, unlike states, it added.Receive the best of The Hindu delivered to your inbox everyday!Please enter a valid email address.",http://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/sbi-research-arm-feels-states-have-leeway-to-cut-petrol-diesel-prices/article24014298.ece,0.044,0.082,0.874,-0.8932

The museum was set up to house memorablia from State Bank of Mysore after its merger with State Bank of India in April 2017. “For decades I had an account at SBM, KG Road, although I stay in Girinagar,” she said. “I am so happy that the authorities have preserved memories with Nenapu, which means memories in Kannada.”With a heritage tag, the 104-year-old SBM was established under the patronage of Mysore Maharaja Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV. “I am happy to take forward the foresight of our Divan M Visvesvaraya to start a bank that would auger well for the welfare of Karnataka,” the king announced at the Economic Conference in 1912 when the decision to start the Bank of Mysore Limited (later changed to the State Bank of Mysore) was taken.







 This is just one of the many interesting details of SBM history displayed at Nenapu within the SBI premises at the Mysore Bank Circle, KG Road.When the SBM merger was a few months away, some senior SBM executives, came forward with the idea of setting up a museum of SBM memories.Some of the meticulously-sourced history of written records and memorabilia includes Bank of Mysore’s primary influence on the State economy, SBM’s appointment as an agent of RBI in 1953 to undertake government business and treasury operations, its transition to becoming a subsidiary of SBI in 1960, to its progressive growth and uninterrupted profits since 1913.







 The Bank of Mysore Limited was started with Rs. 20 lakh advanced as capital by Krishnaraja Wadiyar in its first building allotted in 1913 in Bengaluru. The SBM branch office operated in this historic stone building on KG Road till the merger. The Bank of Mysore shifted to the massive stone building with a beautiful porch constructed in 1923. Its 150-feet long hall is decorated with steel pillars and arches sourced from England.Mysore Bank Circle too gets its name after the oldest bank of Karnataka and its 93-year-old historic building. The museum has a lot of curious visitors, said an SBI executive.







 “I had a 36-year-old connect with SBM. Our attachment pushed us into celebrating memories with a permanent museum.It took 72 days to have the four rooms ready,” Suresh Savekar S, one of the SBM executives, said. Putting the collection together was not an easy task. Taking hints and direction from old SBM souvenirs, A Shashidhar, one of the Nenapu Museum team said, “we didnt leave any stone unturned to have our Nenapu in place.” Referring to Nenapu’s rare inclusions he said, there was an unused cheque by Kannada poet DV Gundappa and Sir M Visveswaraya’s chequebook among others.”While the majestic Mysore Bank stone structure is declared a heritage building, the core Nenapu museum committee says, “The SBI’s Kolkata museum was an eye-opener for us in this endeavour.”Where we discover hidden and not so hidden nooks and crannies in the cityReceive the best of The Hindu delivered to your inbox everyday!",http://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/museum-of-memories/article22396994.ece,0.083,0.012,0.905,0.9879
60,2018-01-08," In what is certainly a first in the public sector banking space, State Bank of India (SBI), the country’s largest lender, has now prescribed a dress code for its entire staff, along with grooming guidelines and etiquette tips.In a communication to all its employees on January 6, the human resources department of SBI said: “In order to ensure an acceptable level of decorum in work place is maintained (sic), all employees should adhere to a model dress code.” The communication has been reviewed by The Hindu.“One of the key elements that contributes to the emotional value and image of a service brand is the way its representatives carry themselves while interacting with customers, associates and other relevant constituents,” the circular said. “Every employee is a Brand Ambassador for the Bank and his or her appearance and demeanour have an impact on the image of the Bank.”The circular also asked staff to wear clean shoes and not slippers and said that “T-Shirts, Jeans and sneakers/sports shoes etc. should not be part of attire.’ Senior male staff in the administrative offices have been asked to wear ‘smart formals’ or ‘smart semi-formals’ and a tie while meeting customers. For senior female employees in the administrative offices, the circular mandated formal Indian or western wear.It had grooming suggestions too: “Avoid unkempt look (unshaven/ruffled hair”; “practice adequate personal hygiene to keep bad breath/body odour away”; and “keep footwear clean at all times”. Other tips included: same colour for shoes and belts, matching socks for trousers, plain ties for check shirts and ties with designs for plain shirts, suits should be from the same fabric length, and “shirt sleeve should exceed the suit/blazer sleeve length by half an inch”.The tips on social etiquette included a strong injunction against belching, especially “when in a meeting or among others; it is highly irritating.” It also advised the staff against “slipping into common language in a formal meeting” as “it is considered unprofessional”.The state-run lender, which now commands over 20% market share after it merged five associate banks and Bharatiya Mahila Bank with itself in April 2016, has about 2.69 lakh employees and over 24,000 branches.Receive the best of The Hindu delivered to your inbox everyday!Please enter a valid email address.",http://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/avoid-belching-at-meetings-sbi-tells-staff/article22399428.ece,0.075,0.009,0.916,0.9686
61,2018-02-20," The recent multi-crore fraud at Punjab National Bank found its reference during the Canada-India Mumbai Business Forum on Tuesday, when a delegate raised the issue of corporate governance being given importance in Canada and how it appeared that the same was not being followed in India, thus giving rise to fraudulent practices.Siddhartha Sengupta, deputy managing director (international banking), State Bank of India (SBI), a panelist discussing ‘Positioning Canadian Strengths in the context of India’s policy agenda’, termed the incident as failure of key controls, while responding to the delegate.“Ethics and risk mean different things for different people. What it means to me as the chairman of the board may not mean the same to a front line officer,” he said.He said that at SBI, ‘a huge amount’ of work has been done in the risk management space. “We need to break risk down to an actionable item that people understand. We talk about processes and e-control, but there was a failure of key controls in the recent incident,” Mr. Sengupta said, without naming PNB. Last week, the second largest lender of the country informed the exchanges about ₹11,500 crore worth of unauthorised transactions after fraudulent letters of undertaking were issued from a branch in Mumbai to secure overseas credit.Mr. Sengupta added that often, the four-eye, six-eye or the sixteen-eye principle — a requirement that a set of individuals review and approve a course of action. “But if those sixteen eyes get together and decide to bring down something, it will come down despite whatever risk management [practices] you have,” he added.“But just because an incident like this has happened, it does not mean that compliance of key controls have lost its importance. It only means that we need to think in terms of additional layers of security and control.”Kashmira Mewawala, head, business development and chief ethics counselor, Tata Capital Financial Services Ltd., said she had seen a rise in adherence to corporate governance and in actually ensuring that people are operating in an ethical way.“I am seeing a substantial increase on this with Indian companies right now. SBI recently appointed a group ethics officer. So, I am seeing that people have begun to realise that this is extremely important and that it is the basis of everything we do.” Referring to the need for institutions that train people in corporate governance, Ms. Mewawala said that India did have a lot of such institutions who do it for independent directors.
